Then you have to decide on the course of action most likely to ensure a successful outcome. Be open to new ideas. Move ahead only when you have considered the consequences of what you propose to do. Be absolutely determined to keep going until you have reached your objective. Be generous and supportive and people will cooperate with you.\nIf you have asked about a relationship issue, the principle remains the same.

Whereas a calm, centred approach enables you to connect with deeper levels of yourself. In that state of mind you will intuitively make the right choices. You will have a sense of the most appropriate action to take in any situation. So focus on being present in the here and now. Do not dwell in the past. Yesterday has gone and cannot be retrieved.

But everyday life is full of distractions which prevent us from being in touch with this natural wisdom. To gain access to it needs a relaxed and quiet mind. This has always been recognized as a most difficult state to achieve. Meditation and yoga are time-honoured methods, as are the martial arts. They help take your focus off the outside world so that you become centred inside yourself. But anything which helps you to experience inner stillness will, with regular practice, be beneficial.
