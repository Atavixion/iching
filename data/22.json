    "desc": "You can influence the situation only in small ways. Use tact and charm. Present yourself in the best possible light. Make the most of your assets and your abilities. You may want to makeminor changes in your environment so that it more accurately reflects your personality and yourtastes. But keep your priorities straight. Do not be conceited or self-indulgent. If you do not value yourself as you are, no amount of material possessions or designer clothes will help to give you a sense of worth. Remember that true beauty, like true happiness, comes from within. An attractive appearance is of little value if it merely disguises a selfish nature. The most elegant surroundings in the world will not bring joy if their owners live in an atmosphere of ill-will. ",
    "descPersonal" : "Each of us projects an image of how we would like to be seen by others. The psychologist Carl Jung called this the persona. A charming and attractive persona is unquestionably a great asset. But it is only one aspect of you, not the whole picture. If you are so involved with your image that you neglect your self-development, your life will become meaningless and superficial. The consequences of putting too much value on appearances are the subject of the novel by Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray. Here the main character manages to preserve his youthful beauty for many years. But he fails to develop any strength of character in the meantime. When his outer mask finally drops away, no trace of physical beauty remains in this once-exquisite face, now ravaged by time and self-indulgence. ",
